# Composition

[`Query`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.query.package) is built on top of
[Mutation]($siteBaseUrl$/Mutation.html) and benefits from the ability of
_mutations_ to modify existing $dbobject$.

Query has the following methods to compose:

* `def ||(other: Query)` (the same as `or`) creates `\$or`
  queries: "`q1 || q2 || q3`" results in "`{\$or: [q1, q2, q3]}`"
* `def &&(other: Query)` (the same as `and`) creates "and" query. The
  specific behaviour depends on the strategy. By default, __Subset__
  tries to pack all fields in a single $dbobject$, but when any of the
  queries makes use of `\$and` or same field names are used, `\$and`
  query will be used.
* `def nor(other: Query)` creates `\$nor` quries.
