# Composition

A [`Query`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.query.package) is built on top of
[Mutation]($siteBaseUrl$/Mutation.html) and benefits from the ability of
_mutations_ to modify existing $dbobject$.

Query has the following methods to compose:

* `def ||(other: Query)` (the same as `or`) creates `\$or`
  queries: "`q1 || q2 || q3`" results in "`{\$or: [q1, q2, q3]}`"
* `def and(other: Query)` creates `\$and`
  queries: "`q1 && q2 && q3`" results in "`{\$and:
  [q1, q2, q3]}`".
* `def nor(other: Query)` creates `\$nor` quries.
  
There is also `def &&(other: Query)` and it behaves not like
`and`. While `and` always generates `\$and` queries, `&&` writes quries
into a key-value $dbobject$ map (MongoDB assumes conjunction in this
case)

> In the case there are several condition operators on the same field,
> only the last operator will be written (since _mutation_ silently
> overwrites key-values when there is a key clash)

```scala
val q: DBObject = f1 === 3 && f2 <= 10
```

would create `q` to be equal to

```json
{
  f1: 3,
  f2: {
    \$lte: 10
  }
}
```

If there are conditions on the same field, __Subset__ writes the last
one only:

```scala
val q: DBObject = (f === 1 && f > 5) and k === 3
```

would create q to be equal to

```json
{
  \$and: {
    f: {
      \$gt: 5
    },
    k: 3
  }
}
```

> There is a more natural way to set several conditions per field,
  more on this in the next section.
