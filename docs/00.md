# Subset

*Subset* is a library to ease extracting fields from MongoDB documents,
serializing them back and constructing queries.

> [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a scalable, high-performance, open-source
> NoSQL document-oriented database. It stores schema-less JSON-like structures.

In short, *Subset* may help you to

* define typed fields and feel safe about both the types of values your application
  reads from MongoDB and the types of values you store into MongoDB, thus keeping
  your MongoDB records sane. As well:

    * utilize and easily write reusable value serializers/deserializers
    * define MongoDB subdocuments

* construct queries to MongoDB based on the fields
* construct MongoDB update operations based on the fields

That said, *Subset* does not provide methods to perform queries to MongoDB, its
only concern is actually about serialization/deserialization.

### Example

The following is a fragment of [REPLable gist](https://gist.github.com/1e9df3f30d58c5eef1df):

> A couple of fields in a tweet JSON:

```scala
val text = "text".fieldOf[String]
val createdAt = "created_at".fieldOf[DateTime]
```

> We may run through MongoDB collection and extract only fields
> we need

```scala
coll.find.iterator foreach {
  case text(t) ~ createdAt(dt) => println(t + " @ " + dt)
}
```

> Actually the tweets contain a subdocument "user".
> Suppose we want it as an object

```scala
case class User(name: String, tweets: Int, description: String)
```

> Let's define a subdocument declaration (we call it *Subset*) with its fields

```scala
object UserDoc extends Subset[User]("user") {
  val tweets = "statuses_count".fieldOf[Int]
  val description = "description".fieldOf[String]
  val name = "screen_name".fieldOf[String]
}
```

> We need a custom ValueReader, in order for the library to extract User
> objects from a document

```scala
implicit val userReader = {
  import UserDoc._
  ValueReader[User]({
    case name(n) ~ tweets(t) ~ description(d) =>
      new User(n,t,d)
  })
}
```

> With all the above, we may extract not only ordinary fields, but
> a User object as well

```scala
coll.find.iterator foreach { 
  case UserDoc(u) ~ text(t) ~ createdAt(dt) =>
    println("%s @ %s: %s".format(u, dt, t))
}
```

> In case we would like to get only recent tweets (for the last 6 hours):

```scala
coll.find(createdAt > DateTime.now.minusHours(6)).iterator foreach { 
  case UserDoc(u) ~ text(t) ~ createdAt(dt) =>
    println("%s @ %s: %s".format(u, dt, t))
}
```
