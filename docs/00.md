# Subset

**Subset** is a library to ease extracting fields from MongoDB documents,
serializing them back and constructing queries.

> [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a scalable, high-performance, open-source
> NoSQL document-oriented database. It stores schema-less JSON-like structures.

In short, **Subset** may help you to

* define typed fields and feel safe about both the types of values your application
  reads from MongoDB and the types of values you store into MongoDB, thus keeping
  your MongoDB records sane. As well:

    * utilize and easily write reusable value serializers/deserializers
    * define MongoDB subdocuments

* construct queries to MongoDB based on the fields
* construct MongoDB update operations based on the fields

That said, **Subset** does _not_ provide methods to perform queries to MongoDB, its
only concern is about documents and their fields. By the way, you may use
**Subset** to serialize/deserialize structured data for subsequent binary transmission.

> [BSON](bsonspec.org/) is a binary format for document storage, that's used by MongoDB.
