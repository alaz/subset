# Caveats

## "Where is my new object's `_id`?"

Suppose you want to insert a new object and you need this object's [`_id`]($objectidUrl$) back?
An approach could be like this

```scala
import Document._

val myobj: DBObject = (field1 -> "value") ~ (field2 -> 14)
collection.insert(myobj) match {
  case wr if wr.getError == null =>
    // no errors. myobj contains the new object's ID
    val DocumentId(id) = myobj
    System.err.println("New object id ="+id)

  case wr =>
    System.err.println("Failed to save the object "+wr.getError)
}
```

[`Document`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.Document\$) object contains a helper method implementing
this algorithm, its signature is

```scala
def newDoc[T <% DBObject](obj: T)(op: DBObject => WriteResult): Either[WriteResult, ObjectId]
```

So that you can rewrite the first snippet as

```scala
newDoc( (field1 -> "value") ~ (field2 -> 14) ) {dbo =>
  collection.insert(dbo)
} fold (
    id => System.err.println("New object id ="+id),
    wr => System.err.println("Failed to save the object "+wr.getError)
  )
```

## `DBCollection.findOne`

Method [`DBCollection.findOne`](http://api.mongodb.org/java/2.7.0/com/mongodb/DBCollection.html#findOne(java.lang.Object))
accepts `Object` and this means an automatic implicit conversion from `Query` to $dbobject$ will not be triggered. Since
MongoDB does not know what it has to do with `Query`, the method invocation will break.

The workaround: you have to explicitly say you want $dbobject$ as a query:

```scala
collection.findOne(Document.DocumentId === oid : DBObject)
```

## DBObject is Mutable

**Subset** *is* immutable, but $dbobject$ (a key-value map storing documents) is
not. You get this object (e.g. from a collection) full of fields, **Subset** lets you
modify some of them, add new ones and then you are storing it back. Since this object
contains a special field [`_id`]($objectidUrl$), MongoDB knows you are modifying an already existing
object, not inserting a new one.

There are two common caveats.

### DBObject Keeps a State

The original $dbobject$ you got somewhere keeps a state, that [`_id`]($objectidUrl$) field. There
is a danger you may forget about it and create a new shiny $dbobject$.

### Schema Compatibility

Moreover, since MongoDB is schemaless, a document in collection may contain some
fields your application does not *still* understand. **Subset** is prepared for
this, it lets you define changes and apply them to the existing $dbobject$. Like
this

```scala
val dbo: DBObject = .... // you have DBObject full of fields

dbo match {
  // You read some fields
  case field(fValue) ~ anotherField(anotherValue) =>
    // you create a modificaton object
    val modification = field( calculateF ) ~ anotherField( calculateAnother )

    // you apply it to the original DBObject
    collection.save(modification(dbo))

  // You have a workaround in the case some fields are missing
  case field(fValue) =>
    collection.save(field(calculateF) ~ anotherField(default) :~> dbo)
}
```

> Instead, you could save `modification` directly -- you shall have a sane
> fresh object with two fields (this can be of help if you'd like to sanitize
> your documents)

```scala
collection.save(modification)
```

**Note** Almost all **Subset** objects are [*Mutations*]($siteBaseUrl$/Mutation.html).
