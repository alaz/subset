# Writing key-value

An `apply` method takes `T` and generates a
[Mutation]($siteBaseUrl$/Mutation.html) that sets a key-value in
$dbobject$:

```scala
val mutation = f(10)
// is the same as
(mutation.get) must equal(BasicDBObjectBuilder.start("f",10).get)

val newObj: DBObject = mutation
newObj must equal(BasicDBObjectBuilder.start("f",10).get)

mutation(existingDBO) must containKeyValue("f", 10)
// is the same as
(mutation :~> existingDBO) must containKeyValue("f", 10)
// is the same as
(existingDBO <~: mutation) must containKeyValue("f", 10)
```

`apply` depends on availability of `ValueWriter[T]` type class. See
[values]($appBaseUrl$/Values.html) for details.

Taking into account ability of mutations to compose, it becomes
possible to create a fresh $dbobject$ with several fields or modify
these fields all at once:

```scala
val subsetMutation = subdoc( Subdoc.inner("val") )

val modifiedDBO = mutation ~ subsetMutation :~> existingDBO
```
