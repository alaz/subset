# Tuples

Sometimes you may want to serialize fields in batches, e.g. two or
three  at a time. __Subset__ has a mechanism for this, it is a `Tuple`
serializer.

Assuming there is a couple of fields defined

```scala
val f = "f".fieldOf[Int]
val g = "g".fieldOf[String]
```

An expression `f ~ g` will create a serializer (and extractor as well)
for `Tuple[Int,String]`. Thus:

```scala
val Tfg = f ~ g

val mutation = Tfg( 10 -> "str" )
```

Here `mutation` will be equivalent to `f(10) ~ g("str")`.

And the extractor will look like:

```scala
dbo match {
  case Tfg(i, s) => 
  case smthElse =>
}
```

Tuples of higher arity are possible too:

```scala
val T3 = Tfg ~ "b".fieldOf[Boolean]
```

> Tuple serializers/deserializers depend on all of their types
> `ValueWriter`s and `ValueReader`s respectively.
