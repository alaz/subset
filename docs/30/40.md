# Sub-document

Suppose you have a model where you store subdocuments in an array,
e.g. (as JSON)

```json
{
  title: "A blog post",
  comments: [
    {
      by: "joe",
      text: "joe's comment",
      votes: 0
    },
    {
      by: "mary",
      text: "mary's comment",
      votes: 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Every comment is represented in the model as

```scala
case class Comment(by: String, votes: Int, text: String)
```

> There is no real necessity to give
> same names to the _case class_'s fields  

And a list of comments is defined in a "blog post" like

```scala
object BlogPost {
  val title = "title".fieldOf[String]
  val comments = "comments".fieldOf[List[Comment]]
```

In order to read `comments` field or write to it or create any queries
or modifications (via MongoDB's "update modifiers"), __Subset__ needs
to know how to serialize and deserialize `Comment` (it already knows
what to do with `List[T]`), so you have to define Comment's reader and
writer:

```scala
object Comment {
  val by = "by".fieldOf[String]
  val votes = "votes".fieldOf[Int]
  val text = "text".fieldOf[String]

  implicit val reader = ValueReader[Comment]({
    case by(by) ~ votes(votes) ~ text(text) =>
      new Comment(by, votes, text)
  })
  implicit val writer = {
    def f(comment: Comment): DBObject =
      ( (by -> comment.by) ~
        (votes -> comment.votes) ~
        (text -> comment.text) )
    ValueWriter(f _)
  }
}
```

> [REPLable example on working with subdocuments (at gist.github.com)](https://gist.github.com/1647326)

With all the above definitions, creating a new $dbobject$ will be like

```scala
import BlogPost._

val dbo: DBObject =
  title("A blog post") ~
  comments(Comment("joe", "joe's comment", 0) ::
           Comment("mary", "mary's comment", 1) ::
           Nil)
```
