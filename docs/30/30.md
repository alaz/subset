# Defining ValueWriter

[`ValueWriter`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.ValueWriter) has a factory method as well

```scala
object ValueWriter {
  def apply[T](sane: (T => Any)): ValueWriter[T]
```

Function `sane` is supposed to perform "normalization" of `T` into
BSON-compatible value.

Looking back to an example of storing Joda's `DateTime`, most likely we
would want to save a `DateTime` as a sane MongoDate value:

```scala
implicit val myDateWriter = ValueWriter(_.toDate)
```
