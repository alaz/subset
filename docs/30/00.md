# Serialization

**Subset**'s units of serialization are ordinary values: the
library needs to know how to create a typed Scala/Java object from a
BSON value and how to convert an object back.

### Subset

**Subset** has an own comprehensive library of serializers for
Java/Scala types (along with `Seq[T]`, `Option[T]`, etc.), with
simple mechanisms for a developer to define own serializers.

All the serializers and deserializers are based on type classes, thus
declared as `implicit`. There are several traits and objects that
compose implicits into packs (e.g. for basic values or Scala complex
type like `Seq[T]`) to help you import only what you want, see
[`com.osinka.subset.values`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.values.package)
