# Serialization

**Subset**'s units of serialization are ordinary values: the
library needs to know how to create a typed Scala/Java object from a
BSON value and how to convert an object back.

**Subset** has an own comprehensive library of serializers for
Java/Scala types (along with `Seq[T]`, `Option[T]`, etc.), with
simple mechanisms for a developer to define own serializers.

```scala
implicit val bigDecimalReader = ValueReader[BigDecimal]({
    case l: Long => BigDecimal(l, 2)
  })
implicit val bigDecimalWriter = ValueWriter[BigDecimal](bd => {
    assert(bd.scale == 2)
    (bd*100).setScale(0).toLong
  })
```

All the serializers and deserializers are based on type classes, thus
declared as `implicit`.
