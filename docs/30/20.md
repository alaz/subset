# Defining ValueReader

Certainly it is possible to simply extend `ValueReader` trait and
implement its own method `unpack`. However, `ValueReader` provides a
factory method to create deserializers from a `PartialFunction[Any,T]`:

```scala
object ValueReader {
  def apply[T](pf: PartialFunction[Any,T]): ValueReaderPf[T]
```

Thus, in order to create an own reader for Joda `DateTime`, we would
do the following:

```scala
implicit val myDateReader = ValueReader[DateTime]({
    case i: Int =>
      // assuming the time is stored in the number of seconds
      // since the epoch
      new DateTime(i*1000L)

    case d: Date =>
      // Java driver unpacks MongoDate into java.util.Date
      new DateTime(d)
  })
```

As you may see we are able to choose different deserialization logic
based on the field contents.

`ValueReaderPf` does more than that, it has methods for composing
several deserializers, see
[`ValueReaderPf` scaladoc]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.ValueReaderPf) and
[`SmartValues` sources](https://github.com/osinka/subset/blob/master/src/main/scala/values/Smart.scala)
