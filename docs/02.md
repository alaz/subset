# Why Subset

[10gen](http://www.10gen.com/) (the company behind
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)) officialy releases a
[Java driver](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center)
and supports the development of
["Casbah"](https://github.com/mongodb/casbah), Scala driver for
MongoDB. There are also a number of other Scala libraries for MongoDB,
most of them are mentioned at this
[page](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Scala+Language+Center). There
is also ["Salat"](https://github.com/novus/salat), which aims at
serializing of Scala case classes only.

Given this range of libraries, there is hardly any gap in
functionality that needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, since Osinka
(the company that built
[mongo-scala-driver](https://github.com/osinka/mongo-scala-driver) and
**Subset**) projects utilize own library to work with MongoDB
([mongo-scala-driver](https://github.com/osinka/mongo-scala-driver))
and we have such an experience, we finally established a number of
requirements:

* ability to work via official mongo-java-driver directly,
* a type-safe mechanism to record transitions of documents
  ($dbobject$), define queries and "update modifiers"
* ability to apply all these to "pure BSON objects", without intent to
  read/write them into MongoDB (that is, independent from storage)

## Design Goals

Thus [__Subset__](https://github.com/osinka/subset) has the following
design goals:

* __Subset__ provides a rich DSL to define typed fields and
  subdocuments, compose them and build queries and update
  operations, expressed finally in terms of a
  [lens]($siteBaseUrl$/Lens.html) for perfect interoperability with
  Java driver.

* It has a library of value serializers/deserializers for common Java
  and Scala types (e.g. Scala's `Symbol`, `Traversable[T]`,
  `Option[T]`, etc.) expressed in terms of _type classes_. **Subset**
  does not utilize reflection.

* __Subset__ tries to be typed, but never at the cost of extra complexity.

It's not:

* a true MongoDB _driver_. Which means, it is not a replacement for
  database querying and modification APIs, original
  __mongo-java-driver__ and __Casbah__ are great at that. So if one
  needs to query/modify MongoDB database, he or she must utilize
  another library. However __Subset__ plays nice with both Java driver
  or __Casbah__. If there is no need to access a database, __Subset__
  still relies on the Java driver to perform BSON encoding/decoding.

* a _mapper_. There is no goal to map all the document's field or
  (contrary) map all Scala object's fields back to a document. A
  developer is free to read a set of fields from a collection and is
  free to update only a fraction of fields as well.

## Limits

You are allowed to do a lot of various things, and to shoot your foot as well. You may
find some possible caveats [here]($siteBaseUrl$/Caveats.html)
