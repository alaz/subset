# Why Subset

10gen (the company behind MongoDB) officialy releases a
[Java driver](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center)
and supports the development of **Casbah**, Scala driver for MongoDB. There are also
a number of other Scala libraries for MongoDB, most of them are mentioned at
this [page](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Scala+Language+Center). There is
also [**Salat**](https://github.com/novus/salat), which aims at serializing of
Scala case classes only.

Given this range of libraries, **Subset** has the following design goals
(very different from the previous Osinka's project of this kind,
[mongo-scala-driver](https://github.com/osinka/mongo-scala-driver))

It is not a replacement for database querying and modification APIs, original
**mongo-java-driver** and **Casbah** are great at that and have 10gen support.
So if one needs to query/modify MongoDB database, he or she must utilize another
library. **Subset** plays nice with both Java driver or **Casbah**. If there is
no need to access the database, **Subset** still relies on the Java driver to
work with MongoDB documents

It has a library of value serializers/deserializers for common Java and Scala
types (e.g. Scala's `Symbol`, `Traversable[T]`, `Option[T]`, etc.). **Subset**
does not utilize reflection, but selects the proper serialization mechanism
via Scala's "implicits". This library usage is optional, it's possible to make
use of **Casbah** support instead.

**Subset** tries to be typed, but never at the cost of extra complexity. You
are allowed to shoot your foot, e.g.

> assuming you have a field `f` of type `Int`

```scala
val f = "f".fieldOf[Int]
```

> though the field update operations accept the same type

```scala
val updateOp = f.set("str") // compiler error!
val updateOp = f.set(10)    // ok
```

> you are still allowed to join it to something logically different, e.g. a
> query

```scala
val wrongJoin = updateOp ~ (f === 3)
```

> This compiles fine, produces a valid `DBObject`, but MongoDB will complain
> if you'll try to use it in `update` method.

The reason is that **Subset** produces as compatible objects as possible. Both
update operation and query condition are `DBObjectLens` objects and they are
compatible with plain `DBObject` by design: you can always modify some existing
`DBObject` you received from another source or driver.
