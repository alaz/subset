# Example

All the following is a fragment of [REPLable gist](https://gist.github.com/1e9df3f30d58c5eef1df):

### Fields

> A couple of fields in a tweet JSON:

```scala
val text = "text".fieldOf[String]
val createdAt = "created_at".fieldOf[DateTime]
```

### Serialization

> We may run through MongoDB collection and extract only fields
> we need

```scala
coll.find.iterator foreach {
  case text(t) ~ createdAt(dt) => println(t + " @ " + dt)
}
```

> Every field provides both extractor (you've seen it above when we extracted the
> field values using pattern matching) and `apply` function to serialize values.
> The result of this `apply` method is a Mutation that modifies DBObjects, which is
> rather cool: they compose; you are free to get a $dbobject$ with only those fields;
> or you may modify an existing $dbobject$

```scala
val changes = text("text") ~ createdAt(new DateTime)

// this will produce a fresh DBObject with two fields
// (you may call changes.get explicitly)
val dbo1: DBObject = changes

// this will modify an existing DBObject
val dboModified: DBObject = changes(exstingDBObject)
```

### Subdocument

> Actually the tweets contain a subdocument "user".
> Suppose we want it as an object

```scala
case class User(name: String, tweets: Int, description: String)

object User {
  val tweets = "statuses_count".fieldOf[Int]
  val description = "description".fieldOf[String]
  val name = "screen_name".fieldOf[String]
}

val user = "user".subset(User).of[User]
```

> First, we have declared a container for the sub-document's fields.
> `user` is an object that denotes it's name represents sub-documents
> of type `User`. Its type could be `List[User]` as well, if
> MongoDB document field "user" stored an array of sub-documents.

> We need a custom
> [ValueReader]($siteBaseUrl$/ValueReader+%26+ValueWriter.html),
> in order for the library to extract User objects from a
> document. (in fact, the best place for this `implicit` is `User`
> object itself)

```scala
implicit val userReader = {
  import User._
  ValueReader[User]({
    case name(n) ~ tweets(t) ~ description(d) =>
      new User(n,t,d)
  })
}
```

> With all the above, we may extract not only ordinary fields, but
> a User object as well

```scala
coll.find.iterator foreach { 
  case user(u) ~ text(t) ~ createdAt(dt) =>
    println("%s @ %s: %s".format(u, dt, t))
}
```

### Querying

> In case we would like to get only recent tweets (for the last 6 hours)
> from a user who has more than 100 tweets:

```scala
coll.find( createdAt > DateTime.now.minusHours(6) &&
           user.where {_.tweets > 100} )
```

### Updating

> How would you get tweets from a user who has more than 100 tweets and mark
> these records with "fromActiveUser" (we shall modify the $dbobject$ and save it back)

```scala
val fromActiveUser = "fromActiveUser".field[Boolean]

coll.find( user.where {_.tweets > 100} ) foreach { dbo =>
  coll.save( fromActiveUser(true) :~> dbo )
}
```

> You could want to accomplish the same task using [`update`](www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating)
> operation

```scala
import Document._

coll.find( user.where{_.tweets > 100} ) foreach {
  case DocumentId(id) =>
    coll.update(DocumentId === id, fromActiveUser.set(true))
  }
}
```
