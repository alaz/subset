# Mutation

_Mutation_ in __Subset__ is an extension of function `(DBObject =>
DBObject)`. __Subset__ makes a heavy use of mutations to accumulate
updates to $dbobject$ values and benefits from mutations composability.

```scala
trait Mutation extends (DBObject => DBObject)
```

[`Mutation`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.Mutation) has the
following methods:

```scala
def get: DBObject
```
> applies the mutation to an empty `DBObject`

```scala
def ~ (other: Mutation): Mutation
```
> composes two mutations together. This is equivalent to the composition
> of two functions `f andThen g`
  
```scala
def :~> (dbo: DBObject): DBObject
```
> applies the mutation to `dbo`. That is, write all accumulated updates to
> the object.

```scala
def <~: (dbo: DBObject): DBObject
```
> The right-associative version, so that one may write `dbo <~: mutation`

A [`Mutation`]($apiUrl$#com.osinka.subset.Mutation\$) companion
object hosts a number of predefined mutations (e.g. writing a value under
some key, removing a key, to name a few), though they are rarely used
directly. Almost everywhere __Subset__ generates `Mutation`: when
one serializes a field's value or builds a query, the result would be
`Mutation` or its subtype. This gives a beautiful flexibility:

* it's very easy to get a fresh $dbobject$ by calling `mutation.get`
  (certainly there is also an implicit, that converts mutations into
  `DBObject`)
* it's always possible to apply a mutation to the existing $dbobject$, so
  that a developer may modify `DBObject` got from any source and keep
  other fields intact.
* mutations compose, accumulating the changes.
