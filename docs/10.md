# Getting Started

## Imports

**Subset** declares most *implicits* via `package object`, so it's a
good idea to import the whole package:

```scala
import com.osinka.subset._
```

The above `import` includes a set of routines to convert Scala types
back and forth to BSON values. Though this set is pretty
comprehensive, __Subset__ also supports a number of "smart"
converters, that try to extract values from another BSON type
(e.g. when a developer expects `Int`, "smart" converters will read a
value both from `Int` BSON field and `String` as well).

> Those who use MongoDB from various programming languages know that a
> field data type is very easy to alter, e.g. you could forget to cast
> a variable to `Int` in PHP and voila, your database contains a
> String BSON field, while your Scala code still expects `Int`.

In order to use "smart" converters,

```scala
import SmartValues._
```

## Joda Time

Import `JodaValues._` in case you use
[Joda Time](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) library. This will let
you save and consume `DateTime` fields

__NOTE:__ **Subset** itself does not depend on "Joda Time" library, it
is declared *optional* in Ivy / Maven configurations. Your project
must depend on "Joda Time" if you use it.

## SBT Configuration

For _simple_ configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.osinka.subset" %% "subset" % "0.6.2"
```

For _scala_ configration:

```scala
lazy val root = Project(....) dependsOn(subset)

lazy val subset = "com.osinka.subset" %% "subset" % "0.6.2"
```

## Maven Configuration

Dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.osinka.subset</groupId>
  <artifactId>subset_2.9.1</artifactId>
  <version>0.6.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Do not forget to add the repository:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
     <id>scala-tools.org</id>
     <name>Scala-Tools Maven2 Repository</name>
     <url>http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
